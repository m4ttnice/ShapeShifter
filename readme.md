# ShapeShifter: A 3D Printing Environment

ShapeShifter is a software tool designed to test and study customized slice profiles for 3D printing. The program simulates a real 3D space that is compatible with a 3D printing machine, allowing users to experiment with different slice profiles and understand the physical implications of their choices on the printed parts.

One of the main goals of ShapeShifter is to study the "dark zones" that a 3D printing machine cannot reach with its tool due to physical constraints, such as the presence of the machine itself or already printed parts. To do this, the program will allow users to test rotated slice profiles and other approaches to slicing in non-Euclidean spaces.

ShapeShifter is intended to be a halfway point between a real CNC machine and a home-use 3D printer, providing a flexible and interactive environment for testing and learning about 3D printing. The program is also designed to be fully open-source and developed and maintained with the assistance of AI, making it a unique and innovative tool for the 3D printing community.

The main goals of ShapeShifter are to:

- Provide a virtual 3D space for testing and studying slice profiles for 3D printing
- Understand the physical implications of different slice profiles on printed parts, including the "dark zones" that a 3D printing machine cannot reach
- Offer a flexible and interactive environment for experimenting with 3D printing
- Use AI assistance to develop and maintain the program
- Make the program fully open-source and available to the community

We hope that ShapeShifter will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in 3D printing, and we look forward to seeing what the community can create with it!
